# Js-Calculator
### Brief Intro
I set out to accomplish this project in order to see if I could efficiently create a working product from a design.
I wanted to use vanilla JS and CSS in order to complete the project.
I also timed myself and it took me 18h to produce this repository.


## The working final product of this project can be found [here](https://tsotne.co.uk/calculator "Js Calculator Project")

### The design I was trying (successfully I think) to mimick can be found [here](https://www.instagram.com/p/BflRpo0lm1o/?taken-by=ui.inspirations)

#### The actual design of the Calculator is one of Jordan Symingtons graphics, his awesome work can be found [here](https://www.instagram.com/jordan.symington/)

### Description
The calcjs file is the finished project.
The other two HTML files are my two previous attempts within the time period. These two files handle the calculations without using a JavaScript Array.
I tried to do this at the begining in order to create a way to display the current calculations as well as the previous ones the user has entered.
This method however made the UI look quite messy after a 2 or 3 calculations. Because of this I thought it would look a lot cleaner to create a JS array and use that to provide one calculation at a time.

### Improvements to be made

I want to create a variable where the previous answer is saved and the user can press a button to call on the previous answer and input it within an equation.
This would save the user from trying to rememeber the previous answer to their previous calculation.

I would also like to create an APP out of this to deploy on both IOS and Android using React Native.
I think the UI is beautiful enough for users to want to use it over the standard Calculator Applications.
However I would also like to add additional functions to this Calculator so it can assume the role of a Scientific Calculator when required.
